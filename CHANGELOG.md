# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Hardware emulation library (nfx::silicon)

- `nfx::silicon`: C++ library dedicated to hardware emulation
- `Silicon.h`: umbrella header for the full `nfx::silicon` public API
- `Types.h`: shared scalar types (`Level`, `Voltage`)

##### signal

- `Signal`: concept and SignalReadType trait for type-safe pin signal access
- `Pin`: single electrical node with digital (Level) and analog (float) signal support

- `tests_Pin`: unit tests for Pin drive, read, release, and observer notifications
- `tests_Wire`: unit tests for Wire attach, resolve, and propagation models
- `tests_Bus`: unit tests for Bus construction, width, wire access, and read
